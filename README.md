# Image-analysis-using-simple-1-hidden-layer-neural-network-and-deep-learning
In this project I have created 1-hidden-layer neural network which is capable of identifying images depending on the label and works as binary image classification as I am here classifying between two images. Then the same work I have extended to deep learning using 3 hidden layer and incorporating the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm as I have observed that gradient descent is taking very long time to converge the minimum cost and maximum number of iterations. These deep learning steps have increased the performance of my system which I have described.
